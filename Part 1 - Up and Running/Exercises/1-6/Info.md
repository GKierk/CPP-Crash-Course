**1-6.** Finally, download a copy of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) C++ 17 Standard from [https://isocpp.org/std/the-standard/](https://isocpp.org/std/the-standard/). Unfortunately, the official ISO standard is copyrighted and must be purchased. Fortunately, you can download a “draft,” free of charge, that differs only cosmetically from the official version.
Note Because the ISO standard’s page numbers differ from version to version, this book will refer to specific sections using the same naming schema as the standard itself. This schema cites sections by enclosing the section name with square brackets. Subsections are appended with period separation. For example, to cite the section on the C++ Object Model, which is contained in the Introduction section, you would write [intro.object].
